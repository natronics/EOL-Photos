### How to use the site:

As new images are posted to NASA's EOL database, they will show up on the front page of EOL browser.
This is not real time data as it usually takes a couple of weeks for the images to get posted by NASA.

## Development Documentation

If you want to run a local copy of the site, or play around with the image scraper follow the install
instructions in the README.
